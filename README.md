Matlab application to automatically update an ANN based on the availability of new training data.

First a simple netwrok of one input and one output was made using the nntool in matlab, which is a graphical interface method.

This network was trained and used to predict outputs for sample inputs.

After that a network of multiple input that gave a single out put was created. which was also trained and used for prediction.

Then a metod that used matlab code was tried to achive what the graphical interface was able to do.

This was so that new data can be inputed and give you an accueate result. 

The matlab coded method was then used to calculate the result for jus a single input.
